## ‚ú® Highlights
| Project | Completion Date | Tools | Project description |
| :-----: | :-------------: | :---: | :-----------------: |
| [The Wiimote Project](https://github.com/dippy2214/The-Wiimote-Project) | Ongoing | C++, Windows API | This project is an application which can connect to a wii remote via a bluetooth connection and emulate keyboards inputs based on the wiimotes button presses, motion controls or IR pointer. the program manages the bluetooth connection, decoding the binary data the wii remote sends through its reports, and is coded soley in C++ using the windows API. |
| [FNAF Bros Brawl](https://github.com/dippy2214/FNAF-Bros-Brawl) | June 2024 | C++, Custom Engine | This project was made with a small team for the PS5, and is a platform fighter game. My main work on this project was on the camera and audio system, both of which I designed myself. I also helped with various bug fixing and menu implementation. |
| [Unity Audio Visualiser](https://github.com/dippy2214/Unity-Audio-Visualiser) | August 2024 | C#, Unity | This project is a simple audio visualiser made in unity, decoding the audio data with fast forier transforms and using this information to change the visuals. the program can also load external audio files that the user puts in a specific folder in their documents. |

| [Unity Vector3 Library](https://github.com/dippy2214/Vector3-Library) | July 2024 | C++ | This project was a little experiment to teach myself about creating and linking against libraries in C++. I remade the unity vector3 library and created some simple tests to check that each function was working as intended. |
| [Xbox Controller Emulator](https://github.com/dippy2214/Xbox-Controller-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Emulator) | June 2024 | C++, XInput | This project is similar to the wiimote project, connecting to an xbox controller and using it to emulate keyboard and mouse inputs, making use of microsofts XInput API. |

My main work on this project was on the dynamic camera and audio system, both of which I designed myself. I also helped with various bug fixing and menu implementation. |
| [Checkers AI](https://github.com/dippy2214/Checkers-AI) | November 2023 | C#, Unity | This project was a checkers AI made by implementing a monte-carlo search tree, with some additional optimisations to improve performance in the end games. I found the development process very interesting, and the value of decoupling data from the UI was essential (and caused me to have to restart the project from scratch the first time round)
