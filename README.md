| [Unity Vector3 Library](https://github.com/dippy2214/Vector3-Library) | July 2024 | C++ | This project was a little experiment to teach myself about creating and linking against libraries in C++. I remade the unity vector3 library and created some simple tests to check that each function was working as intended. |
