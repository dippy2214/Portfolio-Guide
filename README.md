## ‚ú® Highlights
| Project | Completion Date | Tools | Project description |
| :-----: | :-------------: | :---: | :-----------------: |
| [The Wiimote Project](https://github.com/dippy2214/The-Wiimote-Project) | January 2025 | C++, Windows API, (C#, .Net) | This project is an application which can connect to a wii remote via a bluetooth connection and emulate keyboards inputs based on the wiimotes button presses, motion controls or IR pointer. The program manages the bluetooth connection, decoding the binary data the wii remote sends through its reports, and is coded soley in C++ using the windows API. |
| [Checkers AI](https://github.com/dippy2214/Checkers-AI) | November 2024 | C#, Unity | This project is a checkers AI made by implementing a monte-carlo search tree, with some additional optimisations to improve performance in the end games. I found the development process very interesting, and it taught me a lot about the value of decoupling data from the UI. |
| [FNAF Bros Brawl](https://github.com/dippy2214/FNAF-Bros-Brawl) | June 2024 | C++, Custom Engine | This project was made with a small team for the PS5, and is a platform fighter game. My main work on this project was on the camera and audio system, both of which I designed myself. I also helped with various bug fixing and menu implementation. |

| [Unity Audio Visualiser](https://github.com/dippy2214/Unity-Audio-Visualiser) | August 2024 | C#, Unity | This project is a simple audio visualiser made in Unity, decoding the audio data with fast forier transforms and using this information to change the visuals. The program can also load external audio files that the user puts in a specific folder in their documents. |
| [Vector3 Library](https://github.com/dippy2214/Vector3-Library) | July 2024 | C++ | This project was a little experiment to teach myself about creating and linking against libraries in C++. I remade the Unity vector3 library and created some simple tests to check that each function was working as intended. |
| [Xbox Controller Emulator](https://github.com/dippy2214/Xbox-Controller-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Emulator) | June 2024 | C++, XInput | This project is similar to the wiimote project, albeit at a higher level, connecting to an xbox controller and using it to emulate keyboard and mouse inputs by making use of Microsoft's XInput API. |

| [Spider Man Web Swing Mechanic](https://github.com/dippy2214/Web-Swing-Mechanic/blob/main) | November 2024 | C++, Unreal Engine | This demo shows off a 3D web swing mechanic inspired by Sony's Spider Man games, making use of custom physics to create satisfying motions through the scene. I really enjoyed researching the maths for this, and learning my way around Unreal Engine 5, which I experienced for the first time here. |
| [Custom Shaders Scene](https://github.com/dippy2214/Custom-Shaders-Scene) | November 2024 | C++, HLSL, DirectX 3D | In this project I created a scene focusing on showing off custom shaders made with DirectX 3D. The university provided a simple framework, and I implemented effects like heightmaps, normal maps, lighting, shadows and tessellation. Development was enjoyable and a very new area for me, and working in the framework and graphics library was a very interesting experience. |
| [FNAF Bros Brawl](https://github.com/dippy2214/FNAF-Bros-Brawl) | June 2024 | C++, Custom Engine | This project was made with a small team for the PS5, and is a platform fighter game. My main work on this project was on the dynamic camera and audio system, both of which I designed myself. I also helped with various bug fixing and menu implementation. |
