| [The Wiimote Project](https://github.com/dippy2214/The-Wiimote-Project) | Ongoing | C++, Windows API | I have coded an application which can connect to a wii remote via a bluetooth connection and emulate keyboards inputs based on the wii remotes button presses, motion controls or IR pointer. the program manages the bluetooth connection, decoding the binary data the wii remote sends through its reports, and is coded soley in C++ using the windows API. |
